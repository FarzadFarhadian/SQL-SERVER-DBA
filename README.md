# AdventureWorks2012 SQL Server DBA Project
This project showcases my skills as a SQL Server DBA using the AdventureWorks2012 database. The project includes various tasks such as backup, restore, recovery, adding users and logins, creating server roles, creating file groups and partitions, and more.

The project was completed using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and T-SQL commands. The code is organized into separate folders for each task, making it easy to navigate and understand.

The AdventureWorks2012 database is a sample database created by Microsoft for learning and testing purposes. It contains data related to a fictitious bicycle manufacturer, including information about products, sales, customers, and employees.

This project is intended to showcase my skills as a SQL Server DBA and to provide a resource for others to learn from. The code in this repository can be used as a reference for similar tasks or as a starting point for new projects.

Here is a summary of the tasks included in this project:

Backup and restore: The project includes scripts to backup and restore the AdventureWorks2012 database to a different location or server.
